## Summary

## Discussion

**Note 1.** Consider a framework for domain adaptation where the source and target domains are related by 'transformation laws'. That is, there is an underlying collection of transformations that are preserved from one domain to the other. Then, the question is can we speed up learning on the target domain when we've learned the source domain? To answer that, we need to understand how the learned functions transform.
